# Madrigal

Madrigal is a musical discovery app that uses the "Swipe Left" / "Swipe Right" concept to drill down and figure out the answer to the eternal question: "What do I feel like listening to?"

The app is a proof-of-concept, designed by the bright young ladies in the Kenzie Lane Female Entrepreneurship Program.

This is an HTML5 application, built with [Brunch](http://brunch.io), specifically the [Brunch with Whey Protein](https://github.com/dobromir-hristov/brunch-with-whey-protein) recipe. It uses open APIs from [Echonest](http://the.echonest.com/) and [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/).
